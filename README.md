# Semantic Refactor

## Description

A study in refactoring HTML semantics

The source code of the client's website was not semantically written, so I rewrote most of the HTML tags semantically to increase accessibilty of the website and the search engine optimisation (SEO).

I also cleaned up the CSS file to recude the number of redundant elements.
