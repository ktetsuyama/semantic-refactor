## Introduction
The client runs a Social Media Management company and would like a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their site is optimized for search engines.

## Problem

The source code of the client's website was not semantically written. This was negatively effecting search engine optimisation (SEO) and the website was not very Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) compliant.

## Solution

 I rewrote most of the HTML tags semantically to increase the website's WAI-ARIA compliance and the SEO. I also cleaned up the CSS file to reduce the number of redundant elements.
